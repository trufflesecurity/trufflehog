Here, there is no download with `id` `1` or `\"foobar\"` in your repo.\r\n\r\nThe `TypeError` you get when calling `repo.get_download()`is because `get_download` requires an argument as stated in the [reference of classes](https://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub/blob/master/ReferenceOfClasses.md) (See \"Downloads\" in \"class Repository\").\r\n\r\nSo, what argument should you pass to `get_downloads`? Well, the documentation says `id`, so you can first call `get_downloads` which returns a list of `Download`s, and look what is `Download.id`.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that I have no repository to test this with downloads, but here is an example with issues (`g` is a `Github` instance):\r\n\r\n    >>> g.get_user().get_repo( \"PyGithub\" ).get_issues()[0].number\r\n    23\r\n    >>> g.get_user().get_repo( \"PyGithub\" ).get_issue( 23 )\r\n    <github.GithubObjects.GithubObject.GithubObject.Issue instance at 0x10c9aaea8>\r\n\r\n(I took the `number` attribute of the first `Issue`, because the reference says that `get_issue` takes a `number`.)\r\n\r\nI hope it helps.","updated_at":"2012-04-17T21:10:15Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues/comments/5186061","created_at":"2012-04-17T21:10:15Z","user":{"type":"User","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/received_events","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/gists{/gist_id}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/following","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/orgs","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6","gravatar_id":"b68de5ae38616c296fa345d2b9df2225","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"jacquev6","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b68de5ae38616c296fa345d2b9df2225?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/repos","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/subscriptions","id":327146},"id":5186061},{"issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues/4159230","body":"I hope this report will be useful, however, I am not going to be using this package after all.

Indeed, PyGithub has evolved (and stabilized).\n\nMethods that used to return a list of objects now return a `PaginatedList`. `PaginatedList` instances are only iterable (They do not support concatenation as lists do, and you cannot call `len` on them).\n\nThe rationale behind that? It is related to issue #33 and requests returning a large number of objects. In the previous version, creating a list of all the requested objects required a lot of [pagination requests](http://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination), and was quite long. It was a waste of time if the user was interested only in the first elements of that list. Enters `PaginatedList`, which does the pagination requests only when really needed. And it is no more limited to 10 pages.\n\nSo, to achieve what your are trying to do, you have to iterate the `PaginatedList` explicitly, either in a loop, or in the constructor of another collection.\n\nSimple iteration:\n\n    for issue in itertools.chain(\n            repo.get_issues( state = 'closed' ),\n            repo.get_issues( state = 'open' )\n    ):\n        do stuff\n\nReal list from PaginatedList (and then you can have its length):\n\n    issues = list( repo.get_issues( state = 'closed' ) ) + list( repo.get_issues( state = 'open' ) )\n    nb_issues = len( issues )\n","updated_at":"2012-06-26T06:34:33Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues/comments/6568164","created_at":"2012-06-26T06:34:33Z","user":{"type":"User","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/gists{/gist_id}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/events{/privacy}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/followers","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b68de5ae38616c296fa345d2b9df2225?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/following","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/orgs","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/repos","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/starred{/owner}{/repo}","gravatar_id":"b68de5ae38616c296fa345d2b9df2225","login":"jacquev6","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/received_events","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/subscriptions","id":327146},"id":6568164},{"issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues/5259624","body":"I'll try to document this behavior soon.","updated_at":"2012-06-26T06:35:48Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues/comments/6568181","created_at":"2012-06-26T06:35:48Z","user":{"type":"User","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/gists{/gist_id}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/events{/privacy}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/followers","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b68de5ae38616c296fa345d2b9df2225?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/following","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/orgs","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/repos","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/starred{/owner}{/repo}","gravatar_id":"b68de5ae38616c296fa345d2b9df2225","login":"jacquev6","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/received_events","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/subscriptions","id":327146},"id":6568181},{"issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues/5259624","body":"Thanks for this, very helpful.

Indeed, PyGithub has evolved (and stabilized).\n\nMethods that used to return a list of objects now return a `PaginatedList`. `PaginatedList` instances are only iterable (They do not support concatenation as lists do, and you cannot call `len` on them).\n\nThe rationale behind that? It is related to issue #33 and requests returning a large number of objects. In the previous version, creating a list of all the requested objects required a lot of [pagination requests](http://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination), and was quite long. It was a waste of time if the user was interested only in the first elements of that list. Enters `PaginatedList`, which does the pagination requests only when really needed. And it is no more limited to 10 pages.\n\nSo, to achieve what your are trying to do, you have to iterate the `PaginatedList` explicitly, either in a loop, or in the constructor of another collection.\n\nSimple iteration:\n\n    for issue in itertools.chain(\n            repo.get_issues( state = 'closed' ),\n            repo.get_issues( state = 'open' )\n    ):\n        do stuff\n\nReal list from PaginatedList (and then you can have its length):\n\n    issues = list( repo.get_issues( state = 'closed' ) ) + list( repo.get_issues( state = 'open' ) )\n    nb_issues = len( issues )\n","user":{"type":"User","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/repos","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/subscriptions","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/events{/privacy}","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b68de5ae38616c296fa345d2b9df2225?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","login":"jacquev6","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/received_events","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/gists{/gist_id}","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/following","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/orgs","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/starred{/owner}{/repo}","gravatar_id":"b68de5ae38616c296fa345d2b9df2225","id":327146},"id":6568164},{"updated_at":"2012-06-26T06:35:48Z","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues/5259624","created_at":"2012-06-26T06:35:48Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues/comments/6568181","body":"I'll try to document this behavior soon.","user":{"type":"User","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/repos","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/subscriptions","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/events{/privacy}","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b68de5ae38616c296fa345d2b9df2225?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","login":"jacquev6","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/received_events","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/gists{/gist_id}","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/following","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/orgs","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/starred{/owner}{/repo}","gravatar_id":"b68de5ae38616c296fa345d2b9df2225","id":327146},"id":6568181},{"updated_at":"2012-06-26T07:02:14Z","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues/5259624","created_at":"2012-06-26T07:02:14Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues/comments/6568553","body":"Thanks for this, very helpful.

Indeed, PyGithub has evolved (and stabilized).\n\nMethods that used to return a list of objects now return a `PaginatedList`. `PaginatedList` instances are only iterable (They do not support concatenation as lists do, and you cannot call `len` on them).\n\nThe rationale behind that? It is related to issue #33 and requests returning a large number of objects. In the previous version, creating a list of all the requested objects required a lot of [pagination requests](http://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination), and was quite long. It was a waste of time if the user was interested only in the first elements of that list. Enters `PaginatedList`, which does the pagination requests only when really needed.

If you want to avoid the timezone confusion, mayb what is suggested [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/117615/599884) makes most sense: \n\"Keep your internal datetime objects naive and in UTC and convert to your timezone for formatting only. The reason why you probably want naive objects (objects without timezone information) is that many libraries and database adapters have no idea about timezones.\"\nSo maybe it makes sense to just convert the GitAuthor times to UTC when getting them (i.e. apply the offset to the given time), to be consistent with the rest.\n\nThanks about the clarification re: GitTag/Tag. I prefer the date of the tagged commit, though, the tags mark release commits.\n","updated_at":"2012-07-03T07:59:36Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues/comments/6728241","created_at":"2012-07-03T07:59:36Z","user":{"type":"User","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi/received_events","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi/gists{/gist_id}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi/following","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi/orgs","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi","gravatar_id":"2aed663a62fa8bf9f7aebe603d3998bb","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"bilderbuchi","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2aed663a62fa8bf9f7aebe603d3998bb?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi/repos","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi/subscriptions","id":327442},"id":6728241},{"issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues/5387373","body":"If I convert the `GitAuthor.date` to UTC, I loose the information about where the committer lives...

I know it's confusing but we actually have three types of comments on GitHub, so there are\n    three different spots in the API to grab them. Be sure you're looking in the right spot for the data you expect.\n\n    Pull Request comments are the top-level comments found on the Pull Request page. These are retrieved via\n    the Issues API [1] since PRs are essentially specialized Issues. Pull Request review comments are those made\n    against the diff on the PR. You can grab these with the Review Comments API [2]. Finally, line comments made\n    outside the context of a PR on a raw commit can be retrieved via the Commit Comments API [3].\n\n    Armed with that info, let me know if you're not seeing the data you expect and the API call you're making, and I\n    can dig a bit deeper.\n\n    [1] http://developer.github.com/v3/issues/comments/\n    [2] http://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/comments/\n    [3] http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/comments/\n\n    Cheers,\n\nSo, this is coherent with what we can see here: https://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub/pull/57, as `PullRequest.get_comments` uses the Pull Requests API. @nixoz2k7 Is it coherent with your original issue as well?\n\nAnyway, this is misleading, so I will add two methods named `get_issue_comments` (using the Issues API) and `get_review_comments` (synonym for `get_comments`, using the Pull Requests API). Expect this for the middle of next week.","updated_at":"2012-09-05T06:36:26Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues/comments/8288983","created_at":"2012-09-05T06:36:26Z","user":{"type":"User","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/received_events","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/gists{/gist_id}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/following","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/orgs","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6","gravatar_id":"b68de5ae38616c296fa345d2b9df2225","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/starred{/owner}{/repo}","login":"jacquev6","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b68de5ae38616c296fa345d2b9df2225?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/repos","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6/subscriptions","id":327146},"id":8288983},{"issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues/6653907","body":"Thank you, I was just going to open an issue for that.
