Dropping by various and strange framework such as the Cinder, the jQuery, the Rails, the Processing, etc ...\r\n\r\n## the situation \r\n\r\nWhat I have noticed is that a strong architecture and a really ease use of add-ons makes a framework get stronger. For instance, if we take a look at Ruby, we see that the use of gems give him a powerfull advance over his friend php. \r\n\r\n### the Rubyist\r\n\r\nThis way of thinking is getting even better with the http://gembundler.com/ [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) friend. The gems have dependencies and a simple GemFile help to easily install all dependencies for one project.\r\n\r\n### the Cinderist\r\n\r\nFor Cinder, we get the block, as for OSX, it quiet easy and fast. Drag and drop and play/code.\r\n\r\n### the jQueryist\r\n\r\nWell, it is not frequent to have jQuery plugins depending on other jQuery plugins, but there are several way to handle dependencies on jQuery and JS.\r\n\r\n### the nodist\r\n\r\nThis lead us to http://npmjs.org/, which is really nice with dependencies.\r\nFor instance, if you tried cloud9ide, you know that you just have to make sure you get the proper package.json :\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"node-example\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"express\": \"2.2.0\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis file ensure that everything before running the server will be installed via npm.\r\n\r\n### the ofist\r\n\r\nRight now, we just have the addons.make file, which is nice but does not do any lifting for us. We have to verify that the ofx addons has been downloaded and is installed in the right folder.\r\n\r\n- Why not creating a script that will allow to manage dependencies compilation ? \r\nI have this wonderful ofxJSONsettings, but he depends on [JSONCPP](http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net/) and on boost, so here we will have :\r\n\r\npackage.json file in the ofxJSONsettings folder :\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"ofxJSONsettings\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\r\n  \"dependencies\": [{\r\n    \"jsoncpp\": \"0.6.0-rc2\"\r\n    \"url\":\"http://jsoncpp.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jsoncpp/trunk/\"\r\n    \"protocol\":\"svn\"\r\n     }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHum, then, we have our little bash script :\r\n\r\n`xadd -addon ofxJSONsettings`\r\n\r\nand for a project, we have to ensure that the make file run `xadd -addon ofxJSONsettings` if it does not find ofXJSONsettings.\r\n\r\nThis could lead to simplify and easify the use of plugin ! Hey, I want the new [mistubaRenderer](https://github.com/satoruhiga/ofxMitsubaRenderer) let's give a try :\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"ofxMitsubaRenderer\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\r\n  \"dependencies\": [{\r\n    \"mitsuba\": \"0.1\"\r\n    \"url\":\"https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/hg/mitsuba-bidir\"\r\n    \"protocol\":\"hg\"\r\n     }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWell, this would be simplify if everybody use some same pattern, and respect some convention.\r\n\r\nSo what do you guys think about that ?\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you !\r\n\r\n\r\n","number":1063,"pull_request":{"html_url":null,"diff_url":null,"patch_url":null},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1063","labels":[{"color":"d68e22","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/addon","name":"addon"},{"color":"622425","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/feature","name":"feature"},{"color":"37c200","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/development-strategy","name":"development-strategy"}],"id":3627067,"closed_at":null,"created_at":"2012-03-13T10:44:57Z"},{"milestone":{"state":"open","description":"","title":"0072 Release","due_on":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","closed_issues":21,"open_issues":81,"number":5,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/milestones/5","creator":{"gravatar_id":"2aed663a62fa8bf9f7aebe603d3998bb","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi","login":"bilderbuchi","id":327442,"avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2aed663a62fa8bf9f7aebe603d3998bb?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png"},"id":61810,"created_at":"2011-12-02T15:29:48Z"},"state":"open","user":{"gravatar_id":"e5d92e48e175112e9df112e2418bd528","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylemcdonald","login":"kylemcdonald","id":157106,"avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e5d92e48e175112e9df112e2418bd528?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png"},"title":"regularize code for math addons","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1062","comments":4,"assignee":null,"updated_at":"2012-03-12T17:58:20Z","body":"right now there is a lot of duplicated code in the vector math classes. for example, normalize() and getNormalized() have separate implementations. if we follow the pattern of always implementing things in self-modifying methods, then providing copy-returning methods as alternatives, this will reduce the amount of code and make it harder to cause bugs or behavioral discrepancies.\r\n\r\n- implementations of an algorithm should always be self-modifying\r\n- copy-returning versions should be implemented using a differently named method, internally making a copy and calling the self-modifying version on the copy.\r\n\r\ne.g. something like (note, this isn't how it's implemented right now):\r\n\r\n\tinline ofVec2f& ofVec2f::normalize() {\r\n\t\tfloat length = (float)sqrt(x*x + y*y);\r\n\t\tif( length > 0 ) {\r\n\t\t\tx /= length;\r\n\t\t\ty /= length;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\treturn *this;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tinline ofVec2f ofVec2f::getNormalized() const {\r\n\t\tofVec2f result = *this;\r\n\t\treturn result.normalize();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\ntaken from this post https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/1061#issuecomment-4455601","number":1062,"pull_request":{"html_url":null,"diff_url":null,"patch_url":null},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1062","labels":[{"color":"db6a1f","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/core","name":"core"},{"color":"622425","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/feature","name":"feature"},{"color":"37c200","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/development-strategy","name":"development-strategy"}],"id":3614231,"closed_at":null,"created_at":"2012-03-12T16:33:06Z"},{"milestone":null,"state":"open","user":{"gravatar_id":"bea30676dca310e7f38269f245214944","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elliotwoods","login":"elliotwoods","id":328294,"avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bea30676dca310e7f38269f245214944?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png"},"title":"ofVertexes??
