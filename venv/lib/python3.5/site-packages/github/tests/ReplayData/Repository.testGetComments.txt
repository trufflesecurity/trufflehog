[{"updated_at":"2012-05-18T08:46:09Z","position":null,"body":"probably a noob question: does this completion refer to autocompletion in IDE's/editors? \nI have observed that this is pretty erratic sometimes. I'm using PyDev+Eclipse.\nFor example, in the tutorial from the readme, `g.get_u` gets autocompleted correctly, but `g.get_user().get_r` (or any method or attribute applicable to NamedUsers/AuthenticatedUser, really) does not show autocompletion to `g.get_user().get_repo()`. Is that by design? It makes exploring the library/API a bit cumbersome.

So, if the user wants an attribute that has not been received yet, I have to do another request to complete the object.\n\nYet, in version 1.0 (see the milesone), my library will be much more readable for IDEs and their auto-completion mechanisms, because I am giving up the meta-description that I used until 0.6, and I'm now generating much more traditional code, that you will be able to explore as if it was written manually.\n\nIf you want to take the time to open an issue about auto-completion in IDEs, I'll deal with it in milestone 1.0.\n\nThanks !","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jacquev6/PyGithub/comments/1347083","commit_id":"6945921c529be14c3a8f566dd1e483674516d46d","created_at":"2012-05-18T08:59:28Z","path":null,"line":null,"user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacquev6","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b68de5ae38616c296fa345d2b9df2225?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","gravatar_id":"b68de5ae38616c296fa345d2b9df2225","login":"jacquev6","id":327146},"id":1347083,"html_url":"https://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub/commit/6945921c529be14c3a8f566dd1e483674516d46d#commitcomment-1347083"},{"updated_at":"2012-05-18T10:55:55Z","position":null,"body":"Ah, thanks for the clarification. :blush:\n\nI made issue #27 for the autocompletion.
