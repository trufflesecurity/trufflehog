It would scan for folders in am addon's root directory with `example` in the name somewhere, and probably check the requisite structure (`src` folder, `addons.make` in place, etc), then generate the project file just the way it would if the example were in `OF/examples/addons/someExample`. Folder depth is the same, so I hope this is just a matter of adjusting the root folder for the example generation process - `addons` instead of `examples`.\r\n\r\nThoughts?

This would lower the barrier for people getting addons they want/need. Additionally, it would take away/reduce the need/desire to include popular addons in the OF core repo and/or release download, if addons are so easy to get, as part of a workflow we already envision the users to follow in the future (i.e. the PG)\r\n\r\n*Behaviour as it is now/soon:*\r\n\r\nAlice has an idea for a new project. She needs a couple addons for realising her project, and knows which ones. \r\nShe opens a browser to go to ofxaddons.com and/or github to download the addons if she doesn't have them yet and places them into `OF/addons/`. Alice starts the PG. The PG knows about the addons, and allows her to select them for inclusion. She creates a project and starts coding.\r\n\r\n*Desired/envisioned behaviour:*\r\n\r\nBob has an idea for a new project. He needs a couple addons for realising his project, and knows which ones. \r\nBob uses the new version of the PG to create a project. Beside the list of installed addons, the PG offers a dropdown list to select addons to download and place into the proper place. It lets Bob select if he prefers a plain download (to just use the addon), or a cloned git repo (to stay up-to-date and/or propose improvements to the addon author). Bob selects the desired addons to download, waits a while until PG reports that they're in place, and chooses all needed addons from the newly expanded list. He creates a project, and start coding the Next Big Thing, without even needing the browser! Awesome, right?\r\n\r\n*Analysis:*\r\n\r\nAlthough I realize that this is no trivial feature, I think much of what we need is already in place. \r\nPG knows about the repo structure, which addons are already there, etc., and has most of the file-manipulation logic already I think. \r\nofxaddons.com maintains a list of available addons and their locations, so I hope it's rather easy to present this in some machine-readable way for PG consumption (@obviousjim, thoughts?). \r\nWget/curl/git could take care of the download. \r\nofxGUI would have to be extended with a dropdown list, or some other way of (space)efficiently presenting the huge list of addons available.\r\n\r\nPossible issues: \r\nCross-platform way of downloading/git cloning without pulling to many dependencies (Elliot brought this up I think). Maybe have a fallback chain of mechanisms?\r\nAddon structure may not comply to what is expected (for old addons e.g.), so the project wouldn't work in the beginning. The same issue would appear on manual download, though.\r\n\r\n\r\nThoughts and Feedback, please. :-)","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1233","comments":2,"milestone":null,"number":1233,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1233","assignee":null,"title":"PG should offer addons download","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/addon","name":"addon","color":"d68e22"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/feature","name":"feature","color":"622425"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/development-strategy","name":"development-strategy","color":"37c200"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/project+generator","name":"project generator","color":"444444"}],"closed_at":null,"created_at":"2012-05-01T20:15:17Z","state":"open","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi","gravatar_id":"2aed663a62fa8bf9f7aebe603d3998bb","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2aed663a62fa8bf9f7aebe603d3998bb?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","login":"bilderbuchi","id":327442},"id":4373201,"pull_request":{"diff_url":null,"html_url":null,"patch_url":null}},{"updated_at":"2012-05-02T16:11:13Z","body":"should result in a gray circle, instead its white \r\n\r\n\tofColor c(255, 0, 0);\r\n\tc.setSaturation(0);\t\r\n\tofSetColor(c);\r\n\tofFill();\t\r\n\tofCircle(100,400,50);\r\n","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1232","comments":11,"milestone":{"creator":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi","gravatar_id":"2aed663a62fa8bf9f7aebe603d3998bb","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2aed663a62fa8bf9f7aebe603d3998bb?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","login":"bilderbuchi","id":327442},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/milestones/5","number":5,"title":"0072 Release","closed_issues":21,"due_on":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","open_issues":81,"created_at":"2011-12-02T15:29:48Z","state":"open","description":"","id":61810},"number":1232,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1232","assignee":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylemcdonald","gravatar_id":"e5d92e48e175112e9df112e2418bd528","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e5d92e48e175112e9df112e2418bd528?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","login":"kylemcdonald","id":157106},"title":"bug/feature in ofColor::setSaturation ","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/core","name":"core","color":"db6a1f"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/feature","name":"feature","color":"622425"}],"closed_at":null,"created_at":"2012-05-01T17:40:08Z","state":"open","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofTheo","gravatar_id":"3b0860ec0180f7fb7ac4d2cd9252ec3f","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3b0860ec0180f7fb7ac4d2cd9252ec3f?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","login":"ofTheo","id":144000},"id":4370619,"pull_request":{"diff_url":null,"html_url":null,"patch_url":null}},{"updated_at":"2012-05-01T06:35:54Z","body":"How do you feel about passing matrices to ofShader as a uniform?\r\n\r\nsomething like:\r\n\r\n\tvoid ofShader::setUniformMatrix4fv(const char* name, ofMatrix& matrix ) {\r\n\t\tif(bLoaded)\r\n\t\t\tglUniformMatrix4fv(getUniformLocation(name), 1, GL_FALSE, matrix.getPtr());\r\n\t}","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1229","comments":1,"milestone":null,"number":1229,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1229","assignee":null,"title":"pass matrices as uniforms with ofShader ","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/core","name":"core","color":"db6a1f"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/feature","name":"feature","color":"622425"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/section-3D","name":"section-3D","color":"DDDDDD"}],"closed_at":null,"created_at":"2012-04-30T19:49:38Z","state":"open","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/Larsberg","gravatar_id":"bb9a4f7c510339e9d7a447347dc263ba","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bb9a4f7c510339e9d7a447347dc263ba?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","login":"Larsberg","id":346072},"id":4356530,"pull_request":{"diff_url":null,"html_url":null,"patch_url":null}},{"updated_at":"2012-05-04T12:43:13Z","body":"@julapy do we need to add resources that are in bin/data/ to the xcode project for them to get copied to the device?
