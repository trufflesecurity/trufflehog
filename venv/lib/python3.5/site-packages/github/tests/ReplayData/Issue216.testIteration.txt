This would lower the barrier for people getting addons they want/need. Additionally, it would take away/reduce the need/desire to include popular addons in the OF core repo and/or release download, if addons are so easy to get, as part of a workflow we already envision the users to follow in the future (i.e. the PG)\r\n\r\n*Behaviour as it is now/soon:*\r\n\r\nAlice has an idea for a new project. She needs a couple addons for realising her project, and knows which ones. \r\nShe opens a browser to go to ofxaddons.com and/or github to download the addons if she doesn't have them yet and places them into `OF/addons/`. Alice starts the PG. The PG knows about the addons, and allows her to select them for inclusion. She creates a project and starts coding.\r\n\r\n*Desired/envisioned behaviour:*\r\n\r\nBob has an idea for a new project. He needs a couple addons for realising his project, and knows which ones. \r\nBob uses the new version of the PG to create a project. Beside the list of installed addons, the PG offers a dropdown list to select addons to download and place into the proper place. It lets Bob select if he prefers a plain download (to just use the addon), or a cloned git repo (to stay up-to-date and/or propose improvements to the addon author). Bob selects the desired addons to download, waits a while until PG reports that they're in place, and chooses all needed addons from the newly expanded list. He creates a project, and start coding the Next Big Thing, without even needing the browser! Awesome, right?\r\n\r\n*Analysis:*\r\n\r\nAlthough I realize that this is no trivial feature, I think much of what we need is already in place. \r\nPG knows about the repo structure, which addons are already there, etc., and has most of the file-manipulation logic already I think. \r\nofxaddons.com maintains a list of available addons and their locations, so I hope it's rather easy to present this in some machine-readable way for PG consumption (@obviousjim, thoughts?). \r\nWget/curl/git could take care of the download. \r\nofxGUI would have to be extended with a dropdown list, or some other way of (space)efficiently presenting the huge list of addons available.\r\n\r\nPossible issues: \r\nCross-platform way of downloading/git cloning without pulling to many dependencies (Elliot brought this up I think). Maybe have a fallback chain of mechanisms?\r\nAddon structure may not comply to what is expected (for old addons e.g.), so the project wouldn't work in the beginning. The same issue would appear on manual download, though.\r\n\r\n\r\nThoughts and Feedback, please. :-)","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1233","comments":2,"milestone":null,"number":1233,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1233","assignee":null,"title":"PG should offer addons download","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/addon","name":"addon","color":"d68e22"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/feature","name":"feature","color":"622425"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/development-strategy","name":"development-strategy","color":"37c200"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/project+generator","name":"project generator","color":"444444"}],"closed_at":null,"created_at":"2012-05-01T20:15:17Z","state":"open","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi","gravatar_id":"2aed663a62fa8bf9f7aebe603d3998bb","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2aed663a62fa8bf9f7aebe603d3998bb?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","login":"bilderbuchi","id":327442},"id":4373201,"pull_request":{"diff_url":null,"html_url":null,"patch_url":null}},{"updated_at":"2012-05-02T16:11:13Z","body":"should result in a gray circle, instead its white \r\n\r\n\tofColor c(255, 0, 0);\r\n\tc.setSaturation(0);\t\r\n\tofSetColor(c);\r\n\tofFill();\t\r\n\tofCircle(100,400,50);\r\n","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1232","comments":11,"milestone":{"creator":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi","gravatar_id":"2aed663a62fa8bf9f7aebe603d3998bb","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2aed663a62fa8bf9f7aebe603d3998bb?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","login":"bilderbuchi","id":327442},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/milestones/5","number":5,"title":"0072 Release","closed_issues":21,"due_on":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","open_issues":81,"created_at":"2011-12-02T15:29:48Z","state":"open","description":"","id":61810},"number":1232,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1232","assignee":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylemcdonald","gravatar_id":"e5d92e48e175112e9df112e2418bd528","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e5d92e48e175112e9df112e2418bd528?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","login":"kylemcdonald","id":157106},"title":"bug/feature in ofColor::setSaturation ","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/core","name":"core","color":"db6a1f"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/feature","name":"feature","color":"622425"}],"closed_at":null,"created_at":"2012-05-01T17:40:08Z","state":"open","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofTheo","gravatar_id":"3b0860ec0180f7fb7ac4d2cd9252ec3f","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3b0860ec0180f7fb7ac4d2cd9252ec3f?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","login":"ofTheo","id":144000},"id":4370619,"pull_request":{"diff_url":null,"html_url":null,"patch_url":null}},{"updated_at":"2012-05-01T06:35:54Z","body":"How do you feel about passing matrices to ofShader as a uniform?\r\n\r\nsomething like:\r\n\r\n\tvoid ofShader::setUniformMatrix4fv(const char* name, ofMatrix& matrix ) {\r\n\t\tif(bLoaded)\r\n\t\t\tglUniformMatrix4fv(getUniformLocation(name), 1, GL_FALSE, matrix.getPtr());\r\n\t}","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1229","comments":1,"milestone":null,"number":1229,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1229","assignee":null,"title":"pass matrices as uniforms with ofShader ","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/core","name":"core","color":"db6a1f"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/feature","name":"feature","color":"622425"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/section-3D","name":"section-3D","color":"DDDDDD"}],"closed_at":null,"created_at":"2012-04-30T19:49:38Z","state":"open","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/Larsberg","gravatar_id":"bb9a4f7c510339e9d7a447347dc263ba","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bb9a4f7c510339e9d7a447347dc263ba?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","login":"Larsberg","id":346072},"id":4356530,"pull_request":{"diff_url":null,"html_url":null,"patch_url":null}},{"updated_at":"2012-05-04T12:43:13Z","body":"@julapy do we need to add resources that are in bin/data/ to the xcode project for them to get copied to the device?

parameters based on a 'view portal' defined by 3 points (top left, bottom left, bottom right)\r\n\r\nCurrently the changes involve editing ofBaseRenderer (and therefore all other renderers) to support lensOffset parameter (default 0,0).

size of the int type on the platform you are compiling for).\r\nThe problem is due to an incorrect cast in the ostringstream operation inside the loop.\r\nInstead of directly casting the (signed) char from the input character to an unsigned int, the input character must first be cast to an unsigned char.\r\nIn other words, instead of:\r\n```   out << setfill('0') << setw(2) << hex << (unsigned int)

Poco gives us this for free, so it doesn't seem like a huge stretch to think of something like this, plus find and replace, etc.    Would make the regex example much shorter. \r\n\r\np5 has something similar, if that's a helpful argument: \r\n\r\nhttp://processing.org/reference/matchAll_.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\tvector < string > ofxRegex::getMatchedStrings (string contents, string regex );\r\n\tvector < string > ofxRegex::getMatchedStrings (string contents, string regex ){\r\n    \r\n\t    vector < string > results;\r\n\t    RegularExpression regEx(regex);\r\n\t    RegularExpression::Match match;\r\n    \r\n\t    while(regEx.match(contents, match) != 0) {\r\n        \r\n\t        // we get the sub string from the content\r\n\t        // and then trim the content so that we\r\n\t        // can continue to search \r\n\t        string foundStr = contents.substr(match.offset, match.length);\r\n\t        contents = contents.substr(match.offset + match.length);\r\n        \r\n\t        results.push_back(foundStr);\r\n        \r\n\t    }\r\n\t    return results;\r\n\t}","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1110","comments":1,"milestone":null,"number":1110,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1110","assignee":null,"title":"add a simple regex function like ofSplitString()","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/core","name":"core","color":"db6a1f"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/feature","name":"feature","color":"622425"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/fix-proposed","name":"fix-proposed","color":"31e03a"}],"closed_at":null,"created_at":"2012-03-25T18:56:37Z","state":"open","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofZach","gravatar_id":"04ffd573ed878bc5b8c818c3aeaa2d71","login":"ofZach","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/04ffd573ed878bc5b8c818c3aeaa2d71?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","id":142897},"id":3799872,"pull_request":{"patch_url":null,"html_url":null,"diff_url":null}},{"updated_at":"2012-03-25T18:50:13Z","body":"code to recreate: \r\n\r\n//--------------------------------------------------------------\r\nvoid testApp::setup(){\r\n    system(\"pwd;\");\r\n}\r\n\r\n//--------------------------------------------------------------\r\nvoid testApp::update(){\r\n     system(\"pwd;\");\r\n}\r\n\r\n//--------------------------------------------------------------\r\nvoid testApp::draw(){\r\n}\r\n\r\n//--------------------------------------------------------------\r\nvoid testApp::keyPressed(int key){\r\n    cout << ofToDataPath(\"temp\") << endl;\r\n}\r\n\r\nproduces: \r\n\r\n/Users/zach/Desktop/openFrameworks__GIT/_myApps/test/emptyExample/bin\r\n/Users/zach/Desktop/openFrameworks__GIT/_myApps/test/emptyExample/bin\r\n/Users/zach/Desktop/openFrameworks__GIT/_myApps/test/emptyExample/bin\r\n/Users/zach/Desktop/openFrameworks__GIT/_myApps/test/emptyExample/bin\r\n../../../data/temp\r\n/Users/zach/Desktop/openFrameworks__GIT/_myApps/test/emptyExample/bin/emptyExampleDebug.app/Contents/MacOS\r\n/Users/zach/Desktop/openFrameworks__GIT/_myApps/test/emptyExample/bin/emptyExampleDebug.app/Contents/MacOS\r\n\r\nthis is because the code that fixes OSX paths isn't called until you call ofToDataPath().  a good fix I think would be to set ofDataPathRoot (which happens in ofToDataPath) somewhere early in ofRunApp().

Dropping by various and strange framework such as the Cinder, the jQuery, the Rails, the Processing, etc ...\r\n\r\n## the situation \r\n\r\nWhat I have noticed is that a strong architecture and a really ease use of add-ons makes a framework get stronger. For instance, if we take a look at Ruby, we see that the use of gems give him a powerfull advance over his friend php. \r\n\r\n### the Rubyist\r\n\r\nThis way of thinking is getting even better with the http://gembundler.com/ [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) friend. The gems have dependencies and a simple GemFile help to easily install all dependencies for one project.\r\n\r\n### the Cinderist\r\n\r\nFor Cinder, we get the block, as for OSX, it quiet easy and fast. Drag and drop and play/code.\r\n\r\n### the jQueryist\r\n\r\nWell, it is not frequent to have jQuery plugins depending on other jQuery plugins, but there are several way to handle dependencies on jQuery and JS.\r\n\r\n### the nodist\r\n\r\nThis lead us to http://npmjs.org/, which is really nice with dependencies.\r\nFor instance, if you tried cloud9ide, you know that you just have to make sure you get the proper package.json :\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"node-example\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"express\": \"2.2.0\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis file ensure that everything before running the server will be installed via npm.\r\n\r\n### the ofist\r\n\r\nRight now, we just have the addons.make file, which is nice but does not do any lifting for us. We have to verify that the ofx addons has been downloaded and is installed in the right folder.\r\n\r\n- Why not creating a script that will allow to manage dependencies compilation ? \r\nI have this wonderful ofxJSONsettings, but he depends on [JSONCPP](http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net/) and on boost, so here we will have :\r\n\r\npackage.json file in the ofxJSONsettings folder :\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"ofxJSONsettings\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\r\n  \"dependencies\": [{\r\n    \"jsoncpp\": \"0.6.0-rc2\"\r\n    \"url\":\"http://jsoncpp.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jsoncpp/trunk/\"\r\n    \"protocol\":\"svn\"\r\n     }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHum, then, we have our little bash script :\r\n\r\n`xadd -addon ofxJSONsettings`\r\n\r\nand for a project, we have to ensure that the make file run `xadd -addon ofxJSONsettings` if it does not find ofXJSONsettings.\r\n\r\nThis could lead to simplify and easify the use of plugin ! Hey, I want the new [mistubaRenderer](https://github.com/satoruhiga/ofxMitsubaRenderer) let's give a try :\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"ofxMitsubaRenderer\",\r\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\r\n  \"dependencies\": [{\r\n    \"mitsuba\": \"0.1\"\r\n    \"url\":\"https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/hg/mitsuba-bidir\"\r\n    \"protocol\":\"hg\"\r\n     }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWell, this would be simplify if everybody use some same pattern, and respect some convention.\r\n\r\nSo what do you guys think about that ?\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you !\r\n\r\n\r\n","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1063","comments":7,"milestone":null,"number":1063,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1063","assignee":null,"title":"Automatic installer + dependencies handler","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/addon","name":"addon","color":"d68e22"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/feature","name":"feature","color":"622425"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/development-strategy","name":"development-strategy","color":"37c200"}],"closed_at":null,"created_at":"2012-03-13T10:44:57Z","state":"open","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielstuff","gravatar_id":"390ea42c23c2c383f973abdafa24bb07","login":"gabrielstuff","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/390ea42c23c2c383f973abdafa24bb07?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","id":285033},"id":3627067,"pull_request":{"patch_url":null,"html_url":null,"diff_url":null}},{"updated_at":"2012-03-12T17:58:20Z","body":"right now there is a lot of duplicated code in the vector math classes. for example, normalize() and getNormalized() have separate implementations. if we follow the pattern of always implementing things in self-modifying methods, then providing copy-returning methods as alternatives, this will reduce the amount of code and make it harder to cause bugs or behavioral discrepancies.\r\n\r\n- implementations of an algorithm should always be self-modifying\r\n- copy-returning versions should be implemented using a differently named method, internally making a copy and calling the self-modifying version on the copy.\r\n\r\ne.g. something like (note, this isn't how it's implemented right now):\r\n\r\n\tinline ofVec2f& ofVec2f::normalize() {\r\n\t\tfloat length = (float)sqrt(x*x + y*y);\r\n\t\tif( length > 0 ) {\r\n\t\t\tx /= length;\r\n\t\t\ty /= length;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\treturn *this;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tinline ofVec2f ofVec2f::getNormalized() const {\r\n\t\tofVec2f result = *this;\r\n\t\treturn result.normalize();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\ntaken from this post https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/1061#issuecomment-4455601","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1062","comments":4,"milestone":{"creator":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/bilderbuchi","gravatar_id":"2aed663a62fa8bf9f7aebe603d3998bb","login":"bilderbuchi","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2aed663a62fa8bf9f7aebe603d3998bb?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","id":327442},"closed_issues":21,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/milestones/5","number":5,"title":"0072 Release","due_on":"2012-06-25T07:00:00Z","open_issues":81,"created_at":"2011-12-02T15:29:48Z","state":"open","description":"","id":61810},"number":1062,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1062","assignee":null,"title":"regularize code for math addons","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/core","name":"core","color":"db6a1f"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/feature","name":"feature","color":"622425"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/development-strategy","name":"development-strategy","color":"37c200"}],"closed_at":null,"created_at":"2012-03-12T16:33:06Z","state":"open","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylemcdonald","gravatar_id":"e5d92e48e175112e9df112e2418bd528","login":"kylemcdonald","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e5d92e48e175112e9df112e2418bd528?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","id":157106},"id":3614231,"pull_request":{"patch_url":null,"html_url":null,"diff_url":null}},{"updated_at":"2012-03-13T13:07:11Z","body":"Just saw this is the documentation.\r\nVertexes is incorrect (wrong plural)\r\nVertices","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1055","comments":18,"milestone":null,"number":1055,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/1055","assignee":null,"title":"ofVertexes??

Most computers nowadays have several interfaces (wired and wireless). Whereas ofxUDPManager::BindMcast uses INADDR_ANY as the local address, this might be wrong if you are not using the default interface. In my case, I connect the computers in a local wlan. The wlan device is not the primary device on my machine.\r\n\r\nTherefore I rewrote the BindMcast function adding a third argument pLocal, the local Ip address of the network interface.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nbool ofxUDPManager::BindMcast(char *pMcast, unsigned short usPort, char *pLocal)\r\n```\r\nchanging the line: \r\n\r\n```c++\r\nmreq.imr_interface.s_addr = pLocal == \"\" ? INADDR_ANY: inet_addr(pLocal);\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich makes a different header file as well:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nbool BindMcast(char *pMcast, unsigned short usPort, char *pLocal = \"\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the pLocal Adress is optional, if omitted, INADDR_ANY is used (backwards compatibility).\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\n\r\nI've added the function:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nchar* GetInterfaceAddr(const char* interface); //returns the IP of a specified interface\r\n```\r\n\r\nto the ofxUDPManager as well.  This function returns the IP adress of an interface (e.g. en1 on a mac for the airport device). This is useful in dhcp networks, where your own address always changes. The function itself looks like:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nchar* ofxUDPManager::GetInterfaceAddr(const char* interface)\r\n{\r\n\tint fd;\r\n\tstruct ifreq ifr;\r\n\tfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);\r\n\tifr.ifr_addr.sa_family = AF_INET;\r\n\tstrncpy(ifr.ifr_name, interface, IFNAMSIZ-1);\r\n\tioctl(fd, SIOCGIFADDR, &ifr);\r\n\tclose(fd);\r\n\treturn(inet_ntoa(((struct sockaddr_in *)&ifr.ifr_addr)->sin_addr));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease not that for this function, additional headers have to be included in ofxUDPManager.h:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#include <net/if.h>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you consider the changes useful, theres a copy of the two files downloadable here:\r\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/394122/ofxUDPManager_uh_07012012.zip\r\n\r\nregards,\r\nUrs

made a small example which uses the Wikipedia xml api to make queries which are then parsed by an ofXmlSettings object. The problem is Wikipedia complains there is no User-Agent string and dosen't return any data, while threatening to block by IP.\r\n\r\nThe fix was as simple as adding this to ofURLFileLoader.cpp line 144:\r\n<pre>\r\n\t\tHTTPRequest req(HTTPRequest::HTTP_GET, path, HTTPMessage::HTTP_1_1);\r\n        \treq.add(\"User-Agent\", \"Mozilla/5.0 (iPad; U; CPU OS 3_2_1 like Mac OS X; en-us) AppleWebKit/531.21.10 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/7B405\");\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nIt uses the iOS safari user agent string. I think the best fix is to expose the HTTPRequest and HTTPResponse Poco objects so that, like in the ofxHttpUtils, you could add manually the string/value to the request before sending it. I don't think it should be set ti a default within the class. Also, it would be awesome to be able to add data into and pull data out of the requests. This is a great wrapper, especially the threading, I'd just like to have the full req/response control ... perhaps provide a method to add Poco::HttpRequests and recieve Poco::HttpResponses which could be set as references inside the ofxHttpRequest/ofxHttpResponse objects?\r\n\r\nOn another note, ofURLFileLoader seems like a rather specific name for a regular HTTP action.

You should do the same for the targets of those two items. \r\n\r\nImportant: Before clicking the Build and Go, or the Run button, make sure that you choose the deployExamples project in the menu on the toolbar of the project window.

But I can't seem to get similar results with ofCam, even if I do, for example, \r\n\r\ncam.setPosition( tx,ty,tz);\r\ncam.rotate( rx, 1,0,0);\r\ncam.rotate( ry, 0,1,0);\r\ncam.rotate( rz, 0,0,1);\r\n\r\nI still don't get the same results as when I do it via opengl.   This seems like a bug maybe with how ofNode handles rotation?\r\n\r\n(note , I am calling resetTranform() on the camera, so it's not an accumulation of rotations....  it's just that I can't seem to find a way to get ofCam to rotate in the same way as opengl commands). \r\n","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/785","comments":2,"milestone":null,"number":785,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/785","assignee":null,"title":"ofCamera setOrientation gives odd results","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/core","name":"core","color":"db6a1f"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"b31d1d"}],"closed_at":null,"created_at":"2011-10-19T11:16:42Z","state":"open","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/ofZach","gravatar_id":"04ffd573ed878bc5b8c818c3aeaa2d71","login":"ofZach","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/04ffd573ed878bc5b8c818c3aeaa2d71?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","id":142897},"id":1992818,"pull_request":{"diff_url":null,"html_url":null,"patch_url":null}},{"updated_at":"2012-03-09T11:46:35Z","body":"It seems to be happening pretty far in, if you put debug statements in touchesMoved in EAGL view, you will see that y is set to the x value of the touch.\r\n\r\nThis does not occur in debug mode, or in the simulator, and it has to be done with xcode4.

thread. Currently, if there's a lot of drawing then the UIKit elements are delayed and can even pause the update/draw methods entirely. Moving the drawing to it's own thread should help with this.\r\n\r\nI'm still testing, but this looks like it could be a good candidate for core integration. It has examples of threaded, single (what we currently use), and GCD (which I think is iOS 4.0 only) openGL implementation: https://github.com/Volcore/LimbicGL In my early tests, it does fix any pausing of the update/draw with the threaded example (haven't tried the others).

If this is repeated with different modifier+key downs / ups the accumulation occurs.\r\n\r\nUltimately, there needs to be better handling of modifier keys.

ofToString(err) + \" see errno.h for description of the error\");\n\t\tbreak;\n```\n\nSince errno would not be set on windows machines.\n\n\n\n\n### ofxTCPManager.cpp - issue 2\n\nIn the `Receive` method of the `ofxTCPManager`  the function will always return -1 when checking for data and there is no new data and the TCPServer has been set to non-blocking.\n\nAfter changing the code in issue 1 mentioned above i got:\n\n`ofxNetwork:addons\\ofxNetwork\\src\\ofxTCPManager.cpp: 304 unknown error: 10035 see errno.h for description of the error`\n\ninstead of `error: 0` when `errno`was used.\n\nWhich on windows is the [`WSAEWOULDBLOCK`](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms740668.aspx) or `EWOULDBLOCK` as defined in  `ofxNetworkUtils`\n\nSo  someplace in the code there should be a mechanism to check if the code is client is non-blocking and ignore the error.\nThis is `windows` only but still could be as an additional parameter to the `Receive` method. Or add it as an `switch case` for the `EWOULDBLOCK` in the `ofxNetworkUtils` and ignore the ouput and comment it.\n\nI just noticed this above when i started usin an application that i was developing on my mac an using it on windows machines this code would appear too often.\n\nSo as stated above my solution is that i added:\n\n```\n        #ifdef TARGET_WIN32 // otherwise EAGAIN & EWOULDBLOCK will create a \"duplicate case value\" on Non windows\n\tcase EWOULDBLOCK: \n\t\t// \tofLog(OF_LOG_VERBOSE,\"ofxNetwork:\"+file+\": \" +line+\" EWOULDBLOCK: perhaps non-blocking\");\n\t\tbreak;\n        #endif\n```\ncode and ignoring the output.\n\n\n\n","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/590","comments":0,"milestone":null,"number":590,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/590","assignee":null,"title":"ofxTCPManager.receive() - EWOULDBLOCK on Windows","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/core","name":"core","color":"db6a1f"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"b31d1d"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/windows","name":"windows","color":"244569"}],"closed_at":null,"created_at":"2011-05-31T11:31:08Z","state":"open","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/cristobal","gravatar_id":"c7f941e0c10696b758ae8792714a6744","login":"cristobal","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c7f941e0c10696b758ae8792714a6744?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","id":155505},"id":978212,"pull_request":{"diff_url":null,"html_url":null,"patch_url":null}},{"updated_at":"2011-05-31T02:06:22Z","body":"setFromPixels has two forms: one that takes an int channels, another that takes ofImageType.\r\n\r\nsetFromExternalPixels only has one form: it takes an int channels.\r\n\r\nin my opinion, it makes sense to change them both to ofImageType only, because the int channels is susceptible to accidentally passing an ofImageType to it.","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/589","comments":0,"milestone":null,"number":589,"html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/589","assignee":null,"title":"setFromPixels vs setFromExternalPixels","labels":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/core","name":"core","color":"db6a1f"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/development-strategy","name":"development-strategy","color":"37c200"}],"closed_at":null,"created_at":"2011-05-31T02:06:22Z","state":"open","user":{"url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylemcdonald","gravatar_id":"e5d92e48e175112e9df112e2418bd528","login":"kylemcdonald","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e5d92e48e175112e9df112e2418bd528?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","id":157106},"id":976610,"pull_request":{"diff_url":null,"html_url":null,"patch_url":null}},{"updated_at":"2011-12-03T21:54:02Z","body":"ofImage_<T> should be ofBaseImage<Type>, likewise with ofPixels_<T>\n\nin general, X_<T> style classes should be BaseX<Type>\n\ntemplated functions that are just sitting around should also have descriptive template names.\n\nit's important for this to happen before 007, otherwise code will be written against ofImage\\_&lt;T&gt;

Ideally, the testable functions would always be named the same ie myImage.isLoaded(), myVideoGrabber().isLoaded(), myFont.isLoaded() but of course a general name may not apply to all situations (myVideoGrabber.isInited() probably makes more sense).\r\n\r\nHell, all the load functions could be overloaded ie ofImage::load(string filename), ofImage::load(ofPixels pixels), ofImage::load(unsigned char* pixels) across different objects, ofTrueTypeFont::load(string filename), ofVideoGrabber::load(int w, int h, int deviceID). This consistency looks nice to anal me. but might be confusing to newbies and of course would break old code (unless wrapped for legacy compatibility). It seems a little annoying that every objects seems to have it's own way of checking this and that ...","number":463,"pull_request":{"html_url":null,"diff_url":null,"patch_url":null},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/463","labels":[{"color":"db6a1f","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/core","name":"core"},{"color":"37c200","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/development-strategy","name":"development-strategy"}],"id":581395,"closed_at":null,"created_at":"2011-02-07T19:58:23Z"},{"milestone":null,"state":"open","user":{"gravatar_id":"8022cb5f529975afbc64cc9312008d8c","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nardove","login":"nardove","id":277690,"avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8022cb5f529975afbc64cc9312008d8c?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png"},"title":"OpenCV cvSobel() not working with latest master branch","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/462","comments":0,"assignee":null,"updated_at":"2011-02-07T15:58:19Z","body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nI get the following error:\r\n// INIT OF ERROR\r\nOF_WARNING: ofBaseVideoPlayer::setPixelFormat not implemented\r\nOpenCV Error: Assertion failed (src.size() == dst.size() && src.channels() == dst.channels() && ((src.depth() == CV_8U && (dst.depth() == CV_16S || dst.depth() == CV_32F)) || (src.depth() == CV_32F && dst.depth() == CV_32F))) in cvSobel, file /Users/theo/Documents/CODE/__OPENFRAMEWORKS/gitOF/__BuildAllLibs/OpenCV-2.2.0/modules/imgproc/src/deriv.cpp, line 347\r\nterminate called after throwing an instance of 'cv::Exception'\r\n  what():  /Users/theo/Documents/CODE/__OPENFRAMEWORKS/gitOF/__BuildAllLibs/OpenCV-2.2.0/modules/imgproc/src/deriv.cpp:347: error: (-215) src.size() == dst.size() && src.channels() == dst.channels() && ((src.depth() == CV_8U && (dst.depth() == CV_16S || dst.depth() == CV_32F)) || (src.depth() == CV_32F && dst.depth() == CV_32F)) in function cvSobel\r\n// END OF ERROR\r\n\r\nWhen I try to call the cvSobel method like this:\r\ncvSobel( grayImage.getCvImage(), grayImage.getCvImage(), 0, 1, 3 );\r\n\r\nThis works fine in 0062.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n- rS","number":462,"pull_request":{"html_url":null,"diff_url":null,"patch_url":null},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/462","labels":[{"color":"b31d1d","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/labels/bug","name":"bug"}],"id":580717,"closed_at":null,"created_at":"2011-02-07T15:58:19Z"},{"milestone":null,"state":"open","user":{"gravatar_id":"5fa1d3aa502b308b8a3ae814fb88ac04","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danomatika","login":"danomatika","id":480637,"avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5fa1d3aa502b308b8a3ae814fb88ac04?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png"},"title":"get number of input devices and device IDs from ofVideoGrabber","html_url":"https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/461","comments":0,"assignee":null,"updated_at":"2011-02-07T19:38:51Z","body":"Currently, the ofVideoGrabber can list devices to stdout, but does not return the number of available devices.

Add a void testApp::exit() to see if it is called. Run app on ipod touch 2010 version with 4.1 installed.\n\nApp runs OK yet pressing the exit button on front of device quits the app, but xcode keeps running. Digging in a bit it appears not only testApp::exit, but ofExitCallback is not getting called.\n\nSwitch to iPad (no other settings changed) and app runs fine, and exits properly.\n\nSwitch to BaseSDK 3.2 and example runs fine and exits fine on both iPad and iPod.\n\nIdeas? Is this just me? I'm fairly new to OF, XCode and iPhone\n\n[edit]\nOK I worked out that pressing the \"close\" button in 4.1 calls applicationWillResignActive in ofxiPhoneAppDelegate.mm. As a hacky workaround as my app just needs to exit, not sit in background, I added exit(0); to the end of applicationWillResignActive and it seems to work.\n\nWould like to know how to do this
