It's somehow related to https://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues/6, even if I have not described it in details.\r\n\r\nI'm currently doing a very deep rewrite, which will lead to much more readable stack traces in case of exceptions, and I will include more details about the error. I may also be able to detect type errors *before* sending the request to github.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I'm very glad to hear that you have solved a real-life use case using PyGithub :-)","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jacquev6/PyGithub/issues/comments/5449237","id":5449237,"created_at":"2012-05-01T22:03:59Z"},{"user":{"gravatar_id":"b58d0f1ea06b8d5de5f02c53f747ac03","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b58d0f1ea06b8d5de5f02c53f747ac03?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roskakori","login":"roskakori","id":328726},"updated_at":"2012-05-04T19:23:57Z","body":"Good to hear you are already working on this in #6, so I suppose this can be tagged as duplicate and be closed.\r\n\r\nBTW, I cleaned up my script to convert Trac tickets to Github issues and uploaded it to PyPI: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tratihubis/.
