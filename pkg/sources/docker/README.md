# Docker Source

## Overview

The Docker source enables TruffleHog to scan Docker images for secrets, credentials, and sensitive data. It supports scanning images from multiple sources including Docker registries, local Docker daemon, and tarball files.

## Docker Fundamentals

### What is Docker?

Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications and their dependencies into isolated containers. A Docker image is a read-only template used to create containers, consisting of multiple layers stacked on top of each other.

### Key Docker Terminology

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Image** | A read-only template containing application code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies |
| **Layer** | Each modification to an image creates a new layer. Layers are stacked and merged to form the final image |
| **Tag** | A label applied to an image (e.g., `latest`, `v1.0.0`) for version identification |
| **Digest** | A SHA256 hash that uniquely identifies an image or layer |
| **Registry** | A repository for storing and distributing Docker images (e.g., Docker Hub, Quay, GHCR) |
| **Daemon** | The Docker service running on the host that manages containers and images |
| **Tarball** | A compressed archive file containing an exported Docker image |
| **History** | Metadata about how an image was built, including commands executed |

## Features

- **Multiple Image Sources**: Scan images from remote registries, local Docker daemon, or tarball files
- **Layer-by-Layer Scanning**: Examines each layer independently for comprehensive coverage
- **History Metadata Scanning**: Analyzes image build history for exposed secrets in commands
- **Concurrent Processing**: Parallel layer scanning for improved performance
- **Authentication Support**: Multiple authentication methods for private registries
- **File Exclusion**: Configure patterns to skip specific files or directories
- **Size Limits**: Automatically skips files exceeding 50MB to optimize performance

## Configuration

### Connection Types

The Docker source supports several image reference formats:

```go
// Remote registry (default)
"nginx:latest"
"myregistry.com/myapp:v1.0.0"
"gcr.io/project/image@sha256:abcd1234..."

// Local Docker daemon
"docker://nginx:latest"

// Tarball file
"file:///path/to/image.tar"
```
### Authentication Methods

#### 1. Unauthenticated (Public Images)

For public images that don't require authentication:

**YAML Configuration:**
```yaml
sources:
  - type: docker
    name: public-images
    docker:
      unauthenticated: {}
      images:
        - nginx:latest
        - alpine:3.18
```

**CLI Usage:**
```bash
trufflehog docker --image nginx:latest
```

---

#### 2. Basic Authentication

For private registries requiring username and password:

**YAML Configuration:**
```yaml
sources:
  - type: docker
    name: private-registry
    docker:
      basic_auth:
        username: myuser
        password: mypassword
      images:
        - myregistry.com/private-image:latest
        - myregistry.com/another-image:v1.0.0
```

**CLI Usage:**

Trufflehog does not provide basic authentication using username and password through CLI at the moment.

---

#### 3. Bearer Token

For registries using token-based authentication (e.g., Dockerhub registry):

**YAML Configuration:**
```yaml
sources:
  - type: docker
    name: truffle-packages
    docker:
      bearer_token: "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
      images:
        - myorg/myapp:latest
        - myorg/frontend:v2.1.0
```

**CLI Usage:**
```bash
trufflehog docker --image myorg/myapp:latest --bearer-token eyJ_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

---

#### 4. Docker Keychain

Uses credentials from your local Docker configuration (`~/.docker/config.json`):

**YAML Configuration:**
```yaml
sources:
  - type: docker
    name: local-docker-creds
    docker:
      docker_keychain: true
      images:
        - myregistry.com/private-image:latest
        - docker.io/myorg/app:latest
```

**CLI Usage:**
```bash
# First, authenticate with Docker
docker login myregistry.com

# Then scan using stored credentials
trufflehog docker --image myregistry.com/private-image:latest
```

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
# Authenticate with your registry first
docker login
docker login ghcr.io
docker login quay.io

# Verify credentials are stored
cat ~/.docker/config.json
```


### File Exclusion

Exclude specific files or directories from scanning using glob patterns:

```bash
trufflehog docker --image myregistry.com/private-image:latest --exclude-paths **/*.log
```

## How Image Scanning Works

### Scanning Process

1. **Image Retrieval**: Fetches the image from the specified source (registry, daemon, or file)
2. **History Scanning**: Extracts and scans image configuration history for secrets in build commands
3. **Layer Processing**: Iterates through each layer in parallel
4. **File Extraction**: Decompresses and extracts files from each layer
5. **Content Scanning**: Analyzes file contents for secrets and credentials
6. **Chunk Generation**: Emits chunks of data to the detection engine

### What Gets Scanned

- **Layer Contents**: All files within each image layer
- **Build History**: Commands used to build the image (FROM, RUN, ENV, etc.)
- **Configuration**: Environment variables and labels
- **Metadata**: Image annotations and custom metadata

### What Doesn't Get Scanned

- Files larger than 50MB (configurable limit)
- Files matching exclude patterns
- Empty layers (no content changes)

## Usage Examples

### Scanning a Public Image

```bash
trufflehog docker --image nginx:latest
```

### Scanning Multiple Images

```bash
trufflehog docker --image nginx:latest --image postgres:13 --image redis:alpine
```

### Scanning from Local Docker Daemon

```bash
trufflehog docker --image docker://myapp:local
```

### Scanning a Tarball

```bash
# First, save an image to a tarball
docker save myapp:latest -o myapp.tar

# Then scan it
trufflehog docker --image file:///path/to/myapp.tar
```

### Scanning Private Registry with Authentication

```bash
docker login my-registry.io
trufflehog docker --image my-registry.io/private-app:v1.0.0
```

## Testing Results

### Integration Test Results

| Test Case | Status | Command/Configuration | Registry URL | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------------------|--------------|-------|
| Scan remote image on DockerHub | ✅ Success | `--image <image_name>` | https://hub.docker.com/ | Public images work without authentication |
| Scan specific tag of image on DockerHub | ✅ Success | `--image <image_name>:<tag_name>` | https://hub.docker.com/ | Tag specification working correctly |
| Scan remote image on Quay.io | ✅ Success | `--image quay.io/prometheus/prometheus` | https://quay.io/search | Public Quay.io registry supported |
| Scan multiple images | ✅ Success | `--image <image_name> --image <image_name>` | Multiple registries | Sequential scanning of multiple images |
| Scan remote image on DockerHub with token | ✅ Success | Generate token using username and password | https://hub.docker.com/ | Basic auth with PAT working |
| Scan private image on Quay | ⏸️ Halted | N/A | https://quay.io/ | RedHat requires paid account for private repos |
| Scan private image on GHCR | ✅ Success | `--image ghcr.io/<image_name>` | https://github.com/packages | GitHub Container Registry |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Authentication failures with private registries

**Solution**: Ensure credentials are correct and have pull permissions. Use `docker login` first when using Docker Keychain method.

---

**Issue**: Out of memory errors with large images

**Solution**: Reduce concurrency or scan smaller images. Consider increasing available memory.

---

**Issue**: Slow scanning performance

**Solution**: Enable concurrent processing, use local daemon instead of remote registry, or exclude unnecessary directories.

---

**Issue**: Files not being scanned

**Solution**: Check exclude patterns and file size limits. Verify files are under 50MB.
